<h1> Simple Function Plotter Using p5.js </h1>

This is a “function plotter” that I made using p5.js, I put quotation marks on function plotter because I don't really know if this is the right term for it? I originally called it a graphic calculator (if you look into the files, you're probably going to see me referring to it as such), but I'm not so sure about this right now. If you know the correct term, then feel free to correct me!
